###Plot
Life was threatened. People are fighting not for food and water, but for air. 
There was no more food on Earth, only algae that could survive in harsh conditions. 
And only you, our hero, can change everything.
The scientists of your country in the distant future have created a device that
allows you to return to the past. The candidate (You) was chosen, who
go to the past, and solve the problem of disappearing people (this can be
nuclear war, chemical disaster, or anything to blame for).
After numerous surgeries, you became a cyborg. Now you
dependent on energy, as a drug addict from a regular dose.
It was certain that everything went to hell in the distant 2017, when
The aggressor country (the country is determined randomly) started developing
new (nuclear / chemical) weapons. Almost all of your energy was collected to send you 
into a distant lonely way, and prevent the production of these weapons 
(well, you can kill Hitler).
Everything happened in the blink of an eye. You're lying in the field on the grass. Around is clean
air, sounds of murmuring water and the singing of birds. It seems to you that you are in heaven, but
no. You are still alive, a jump into the past was a success, which means that you need as much as possible
faster to get to the nearest city.
What a pity you still do not know, but you're not in 2017, but in (1970-1980), in
times of neon advertising, disco (and hippies) and a thick layer of gel on the hair.
Now you have to collect energy in all possible ways.
Small leaps led into the future. You will come nearer by 2017 and change the course
events and the whole history of mankind. But be careful: the slightest
change now can lead to the "butterfly effect"! Will you
return to your relatives?... depends only on your taken
decisions...

###Mechanics:
The hero has only one ability: **travelling through time** for a certain amount of energy.

The further in time the journey, the more energy is required for the jump. 
**Energy** at each level is **limited**, but it can be replenished from batteries or from a street lamp.
Our superpower can be used in many ways:
  • to foresee the future (short-term leap forward);
  • change the past (for example, divert the attention of the guard while you steal important drawing);
  • clone yourself (make a few copies of yourself, that would move /lift a heavy object or break the door);
  • carry an object from the past to the future (take the key, open the door, and
Back in the past, until no one noticed).
You can also copy objects (make a super-power laser of several small, build a wall of one brick, etc.).
